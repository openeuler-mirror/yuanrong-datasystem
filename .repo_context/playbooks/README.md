# Playbooks

`playbooks/` is the task-oriented layer of `.repo_context/`.

Use a playbook when the question is not "what is this module?" but "how should I work in this repo for this task type?"

## Standardization Rules

- use `.repo_context/templates/feature-playbook-template.md` for new feature playbooks;
- each non-trivial feature should either reuse an existing feature playbook or create/update a matching one;
- if a feature changes compatibility-sensitive behavior, shared infra behavior, or cross-module contracts, the playbook is required rather than optional;
- when a module area is newly backfilled or substantially deepened, explicitly assess whether it now needs a matching
  feature playbook instead of leaving workflow guidance implicit;
- when the task is explicit module-context generation or backfill, use an upkeep playbook and aim for a canonical,
  complete context package instead of a partial patch note;
- playbooks should record both the implementation steps and the risk gates that decide when to stop and escalate.
- review playbooks should lead with defect findings and use repository-level performance, recovery, and concurrency
  gates before style-only feedback.

## Current Status

This layer is now partially seeded. General workflow still lives in:

- `maintenance.md`
- `modules/quality/tests-and-reproduction.md`
- `modules/quality/build-test-debug.md`

Task-oriented guidance now starts in:

- `operations/README.md`
- `operations/incident-triage.md`
- `operations/performance-investigation.md`
- `reviews/README.md`
- `reviews/pr-review-checklist.md`
- `upkeep/README.md`
- `upkeep/ai-self-verification.md`
- `upkeep/module-context-generation.md`
- `upkeep/skill-trigger-routing.md`
- `features/README.md`
- `features/infra-engineering-workflow.md`
- `features/performance-change.md`
- `features/concurrency-and-memory-safety.md`
- `features/recovery-and-persistence.md`
- `features/runtime/README.md`
- `features/runtime/cluster-manager/README.md`
- `features/runtime/cluster-manager/implementation.md`
- `features/runtime/etcd-metadata/README.md`
- `features/runtime/etcd-metadata/implementation.md`
- `features/runtime/hash-ring/README.md`
- `features/runtime/hash-ring/implementation.md`
- `features/quality/README.md`
- `features/quality/test-implementation.md`
- `features/infra/README.md`
- `features/infra/l2cache/README.md`
- `features/infra/l2cache/implementation.md`
- `features/infra/slot/README.md`
- `features/infra/slot/implementation.md`
- `features/infra/logging/README.md`
- `features/infra/logging/implementation.md`

## Planned Playbooks

- `bugfix-reproduction.md`
- `context-update-rules.md`
- more `features/*.md` playbooks for compatibility-sensitive modules
- more `operations/*.md` playbooks for deployment, rollout, and recovery workflows

## Rule Of Thumb

- module docs answer ownership and structure questions
- playbooks answer workflow and execution questions
