# Building with CMake

## Build

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to build to keep
things simple.

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a single-configuration
generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=Y
cmake --build build
```

## Install

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to install to keep
things simple. As a prerequisite, the project has to be built with the above
commands already.

The below commands require at least CMake 3.15 to run, because that is the
version in which [Install a Project][2] was added.

Here is the command for installing the release mode artifacts with a
single-configuration generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
cmake --install build
```

### CMake package

This project exports a CMake package to be used with the [`find_package`][3]
command of CMake:

* Package name: `p2p-transfer`
* Target name: `p2p-transfer::p2p-transfer`

Example usage:

```cmake
find_package(p2p-transfer REQUIRED)
# Declare the imported target as a build requirement using PRIVATE, where
# project_target is a target created in the consuming project
target_link_libraries(
    project_target PRIVATE
    p2p-transfer::p2p-transfer
)
```

### Note to packagers

The `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR` is set to a path other than just `include` if
the project is configured as a top level project to avoid indirectly including
other libraries when installed to a common prefix. Please review the
[install-rules.cmake](cmake/install-rules.cmake) file for the full set of
install rules.
